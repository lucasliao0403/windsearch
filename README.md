## What it does

Ask "weather in San Francisco" and it finds nearby weather stations, pulls their latest readings, and explains what's happening. Shows real measurements, not forecasts.

- Natural language weather queries with conversational follow-ups
- Real-time data from global weather stations
- AI analysis with quick insights and detailed summaries
- Interactive charts showing temperature, pressure, and wind trends
- Smart context awareness for follow-up questions
- Perplexity-style interface that moves search to bottom after first query
- Performance optimized with debouncing and memory management
- Lenient data validation that works with historical data

## How it works

1. Extract location from your query using Claude AI (with conversation context)
2. Find coordinates and nearest weather stations
3. Pull real-time data from Windborne Systems API
4. Stream quick analysis, then generate detailed markdown summary
5. Display interactive charts showing trends across stations
6. Maintain conversation history for intelligent follow-up questions
7. Handle data with LLM validation for older measurements
